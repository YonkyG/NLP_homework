Claim: ADAR1 binds to Dicer to cleave pre-miRNA.
Claim Label: SUPPORT
No.1 Verification: NOT_ENOUGH_INFO
Document Title: Phosphate and R2D2 restrict the substrate specificity of Dicer-2, an ATP-driven ribonuclease.
Related Evidence: [1]: We find that purified Dicer-2 can efficiently cleave pre-miRNA, but that inorganic phosphate and the Dicer-2 partner protein R2D2 inhibit pre-miRNA cleavage.
No.2 Verification: SUPPORT
Document Title: ADAR1 Forms a Complex with Dicer to Promote MicroRNA Processing and RNA-Induced Gene Silencing
Related Evidence: [1]: Most importantly, ADAR1 increases the maximum rate (Vmax) of pre-microRNA (miRNA) cleavage by Dicer and facilitates loading of miRNA onto RNA-induced silencing complexes, identifying a new role of ADAR1 in miRNA processing and RNAi mechanisms.

Claim: AIRE is expressed in some skin tumors.
Claim Label: SUPPORT
No.1 Verification: SUPPORT
Document Title: Keratin-dependent regulation of Aire and gene expression in skin tumor keratinocytes
Related Evidence: [1]: We report that autoimmune regulator (Aire), a transcriptional regulator, is inducibly expressed in human and mouse tumor keratinocytes in a K17-dependent manner and is required for timely onset of Gli2-induced skin tumorigenesis in mice. [2]: The induction of Aire mRNA in keratinocytes depends on a functional interaction between K17 and the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein hnRNP K. Further, K17 colocalizes with Aire protein in the nucleus of tumor-prone keratinocytes, and each factor is bound to a specific promoter region featuring an NF-¦ÊB consensus sequence in a relevant subset of K17- and Aire-dependent proinflammatory genes.

Document Title: The Immune Response to Melanoma Is Limited by Thymic Selection of Self-Antigens
Related Evidence: [1]: Similarly, the enlarged T cell repertoire in AIRE(-/-) mice enables them to mount anti-MAA and anti-melanoma responses as shown by increased anti-melanoma antibodies, and enhanced CD4(+) and MAA-specific CD8(+) T cell responses after melanoma challenge. [2]: TRP-2 (tyrosinase-related protein), on the other hand, is absent from TECs and consequently TRP-2 specific CD8(+) T cells were found in both AIRE(-/-) and AIRE(+/+) mice.
